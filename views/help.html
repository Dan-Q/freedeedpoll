<h1>Help</h1>

<p>
  FreeDeedPoll.org.uk is a free and open-source website that, since 2011, has helped tens of thousands of
  British citizens to change their legally-recognised name for free.
</p>

<p>
  If you need help with the site or with changing your name using a free deed poll, please see
  the <a href="/faq/">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There's also a
  <a href="/rejection/">guide for if an organisation rejects your deed poll</a>. Most people don't
  need it, but if you do, it's there to help.

  <strong>If you've read those page and still need help</strong>, you're welcome to email me on
  <a href="mailto:dan@freedeedpoll.org.uk">dan@freedeedpoll.org.uk</a>. This address attracts a lot of spam, so
  please use a clear and explicit subject line that summarises the query within, e.g.
  <em>"Free Deed Poll: I have dual citizenship - can I use a free deed poll?"</em>.
  I am not a lawyer and cannot provide legal advice, but I've helped many hundreds of
  people who've had difficulties changing their names and I'll do my best to help you.
