<h1>Checklist</h1>

<p>
  Before you <a href="/start">create your free deed poll</a>, here are a few things you should check:
</p>

<ul class="deed-poll-checklist">
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-citizenship">
    <label for="checklist-citizenship">
      You are a British citizen
    </label>
    <small>
      You must be a British citizen to change your name in this way.
    </small>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-age">
    <label for="checklist-age">
      You are 18 years of age or older (or 16, with parental consent)
    </label>
    <small>
      The procedure for changing the name of a child under 16 is different, and more-complicated.
      If you're 16 or 17, <a href="/faq#under-18">see the FAQ</a>.
    </small>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-id">
    <label for="checklist-id">
      You have government-issued photo ID <em>(optional)</em>
    </label>
    <small>
      It's not essential, but if you have a passport, driving licence, or other government-issued photo ID,
      this will make it <em>much easier</em> for you to prove your change of name to institutions like banks.
      Note that you may need to renew your ID after changing your name, which can involve a fee.
    </small>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-printer">
    <label for="checklist-printer">
      You have access to a printer
    </label>
    <small>
      You'll need to print out your deed poll. You might like to print multiple "original" copies.
      We recommend printing onto a heavyweight paper, like parchment paper.
    </small>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-witnesses">
    <label for="checklist-witnesses">
      You can find two witnesses
    </label>
    <small>
      You'll need two people who know you personally, and preferably who are not close relatives, to
      witness your deed poll. Friends, neighbours, and co-workers are all good choices.
    </small>
  </li>
</ul>
