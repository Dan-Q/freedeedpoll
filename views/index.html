<h1>How to change your name for free</h1>
<p>
  As a British citizen, you have a right to be known by (almost) any
  name you choose, by creating a deed poll.
</p>
<p>
  Plenty of people will charge you for the privilege, but there's no
  need to pay a penny! You can join the tens of thousands of people who've 
  changed their name for free using this website.
</p>
<p>
  Here's what you need to do:
</p>

<article>
  <ol style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    <li>
      First, <a href="/checklist">read the checklist</a> to make sure you
      have everything you need. If you've got any questions,
      <a href="/faq">see if they've been answered already</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, <a href="/start" style="font-weight: bold;">fill out a form to create your deed
      poll</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Print it out, sign it, and send copies of it to
      <a href="/next">the relevant places</a>. You don't need to wait: you can start
      using your new name right away!
    </li>
  </ol>
</article>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/start" role="button">Get started</a>
</p>

<h2>Is this legal? Is this really free? Is this safe?</h2>
<p>
  Yes, yes, and yes!
