<h2 id="changing-your-name">Changing your name</h2>

<details id="how-do-i-change-my-name">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">How do I change my name?</summary>
  <p>
    Common law in the United Kingdom dictates that your legal name is simply <em>the name that you are known by</em>.
    This means that, in theory, somebody who is <em>known by</em> a particular name can consider that their
    legal name. There's no specific process requied: just start using the new name!
  </p>
  <p>
    However: in practice, institutions in our modern world expect to see paperwork that backs up your assertion
    that your name has changed. That paperwork might be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>a certificate of marriage or civil partnership</strong>, by which one partner adopts the surname
      of the other,
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>a decree of divorce or dissolution</strong>, coupled with evidence of a name used prior to
      marriage or civil partnership, by which a person reverts to their pre-marital surname,
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>a statutory declaration</strong>, typically sworn in front of a magistrate or solicitor, or
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>a deed poll</strong>, a self-written statement of your name change, signed in the presence of
      witnesses.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This website provides help and support with producing a deed poll for free.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="what-next">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">What do I need to do after I change my name?</summary>
  <p>
    After you change your name, you're legally-required to notify organisations with whom you have a professional
    relationship. <a href="/next">Here's a non-exhaustive list of people you'll need to contact</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of these organisations will require sight of your deed poll, and many will not accept a photocopy. For
    this reason, it's worthwhile to make <em>multiple originals</em> by printing out several copies of your deed
    poll and signing them all (with your witnesses) in a single sitting.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's highly-recommended to get any photo ID, and especially government-issued photo ID like passports and
    driving licenses, updated <em>early</em>, because having these documents available can streamline the process
    of getting your name updated at other organisations such as your bank.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="why-change-name">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Why would I change my name?</summary>
  <p>
    There are many reasons why you might want to change your name. Some common reasons include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To share a surname with a partner, child, or other family member</li>
    <li>To have a name that better reflects your cultural identity</li>
    <li>To formally make use of a nickname that you're already known by</li>
    <li>To make your name easier to pronounce or spell</li>
    <li>To represent a new start or a fresh beginning</li>
    <li>To assert your independence from your previous name and those you shared it with</li>
    <li>To avoid confusion with someone more-famous who shares your previous name</li>
    <li>To better reflect your gender identity, or to avoid being misgendered</li>
    <li>To add, remove, or re-arrange your middle name(s)</li>
    <li>To avoid discrimination based on your previous name</li>
    <li>To revert a name to its historical form</li>
    <li>To recognise someone important to you by adopting some or all of their name</li>
    <li>To adopt a name that is more-fitting to your religious beliefs</li>
    <li>To make day-to-day use of a stage name or pen name for which you've become known</li>
    <li>To have an unusual name that brings you amusement or joy</li>
    <li>To simply having a name that you prefer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It doesn't matter what your reason is, though: with few limitations (described elsewhere in this
    FAQ), you're legally entitled to change your name to whatever you want, for any reason you want.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="legal-restrictions">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Are there any restrictions on what names I can change to?</summary>
  <p>
    British law imposes very few <em>specific</em> restrictions on what a person's name can be. However, laws
    that are not specifically-related to names can imply limitations on what names are allowable. If that sounds
    wooly... it's because it is!
  </p>
  <p>
    What this means in practice is that the "rules" listed below are variably-enforced. If you choose to violate
    any of them with your deed poll, you can expect to have a harder time getting your name updated on ID and elsewhere.
    If you choose to violate several of them, you're likely to have a <em>very</em> difficult time. The rules are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You must have (at least) two full names.
    </li>
    <li>
      It must be possible to write your name using only the Latin alphabet. You can't use e.g. numbers, symbols, or
      characters from other alphabets. Hyphens and apostrophes are permitted for the purpose of e.g. double-barrelled
      names and names like O'Reilly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your name must be pronounceable.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your name should not imply a title that you do not hold; for example, changing your first name to "Lord" or
      "Doctor" might be interpreted as an attempt to commit fraud.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your name may not promote crime, violence, or racial or religious hatred. It may not be knowingly offensive
      or blasphemous.
    </li>
    <li>
      If your name is extremely long or short, it may need to be shortened for use in some systems, which can include
      your passport and other forms of ID. Furthermore, very long names might not be printable on PDF versions of
      deeds poll generated by this site: in this case, you'll have to use the "text" version and format it into a
      document for yourself (e.g. using Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, or a similar tool).
    </li>
    <li>
      It is the policy of HM Passport Office to deny passport applications that they feel are for "temporary" names,
      names which contain a political message, and names which appear to infringe upon established trademarks, among
      other restrictions. With some effort, they can sometimes be persuaded to put your new name as an "also known
      as" on a passport that shows your old name.
    </li>
    <li>
      While it's fine to make your name the same as somebody else's, attempting to use it to pass yourself off as
      them or to cash-in on their accomplishments is likely to see you on the receiving end of legal action.
    </li>
  </ul>

<details id="under-18">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">I am 16 or 17 years old. What do I need to do?</summary>
  <p>
    If you are 16 or 17 years old, you can use a regular adult deed poll, but when using it you may need to
    demonstrate that you have the consent of your parents to change your name. The easiest way to do this is
    for them to write and sign a letter that states what you're changing your name from and to, and that they
    approve of it. The letter should have the same date as your deed poll and you should keep them together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The letter should be signed by
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/who-has-parental-responsibility">everybody with <em>parental responsibility</em> for you</a>;
    note that this is not always the same at <em>custody</em> and can even include a parent with whom you have
    no contact.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="under-16">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Can a child under the age of 16 change their name by deed poll?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes, but the process is significantly more-complicated, with many potential pitfalls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, this website can't help you with this, but we've heard that some people have been successful
    in "simple" cases by adapting an adult deed poll
    <a href="https://danq.me/projects/freedeedpoll/#comment-85003">as described here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A crticial consideration is that you ensure that
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/who-has-parental-responsibility">everybody with <em>parental responsibility</em></a>
    for the child is a signatory to the deed poll. This is important, because parental responsibility is different
    and distinct from <em>custody</em> or <em>care</em>.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="change-of-title">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">How can I change my title? (Mr, Mrs, Ms, etc.)</summary>
  <p>
    Titles are not part of your name. They are a separate entity, and you do not - and probably
    <em>should</em> not, try to change them using a deed poll. We recoommend that you do not include your
    title on your deed poll at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    A person may use any informal honorific (e.g. Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms, Mx, etc.) they like, regardless of their
    gender, age, or marital status. Simply inform organisations that you deal with what title you expect them
    to use for you, and they will generally comply. Sometimes organisations will ask for "proof" of a change
    of title, but this is a nonsense request because for informal titles there is nothing that could possibly
    <em>be</em> proof, because they are - after all - entirely a matter of personal preference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Formal honorifics (e.g. Dr, Sir, Lady etc.) are also not part of your name and so do not belong on a deed
    poll. But they're also not something you're permitted to just start using: you need the relevant
    title or qualification. Changing your name to one that <em>implies</em> a title that you don't have
    (e.g. changing your first and middle names to "His Majesty") could land you in trouble: see
    <a href="#legal-restrictions">the FAQ entry on legal restrictions</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    But in short: your title has nothing to do with your name, and you can use any informal honorific you like.
  </p>

<details id="vaisey">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Why do I need to check a box if I've changed my first name?</summary>
  <p>
    As a Common law system, what is and is-not legal in England and Wales is impacted by <em>precedent</em>:
    that is to say, previous cases that have been decided by the courts.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a 1946 decision, Justice Harry Vaisey stated his opinion that a deed poll can not be used to change a
    person's first name. This precedent is generally ignored, but to allow for deeds poll that change a person's
    first name to be enrolled, should that be desired, such a deed poll will usually include a caveat to the
    effect of "Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in Re: Parrott, Cox v Parrott, the applicant
    desires the enrolment to proceed". This statement shows that the signatory is aware of the legal precedent
    and, like most people since Vaisey's decision, is choosing to treat it as invalid.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site asks you to check a box if you've changed your first name in order to know whether or not to add
    this line to your deed poll. If you're certain that you will wish need to enroll your deed poll (which
    is something you'll probably never want to do), then it would be harmless to leave the box unchecked.
    Checking it (in the instance that you've changed your first name) merely keeps your legal options open.
  </p>

<details id="change-of-gender">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">How can I gain recognition for a change of gender?</summary>
  <p>
    If you're transitioning to a new gender and are adopting a new name as part of that transition, you can
    change your name by deed poll. You can do this either before or after applying for a Gender Recognition
    Certificate (GRC), but please note that the name that appears on the GRC will be the name that you used
    at the time: in order words - <strong>if you want your GRC to include your new name, then you should make
    a deed poll <em>before</em> you apply for the GRC</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To successfully apply for a GRC, you need to (among
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate/who-can-apply">other requirements</a>)
    be able to demonstrate that you've been living as your affirmed gender for at least two years.
    Changing your name by deed poll can contribute to the evidence that you've been living as your affirmed
    gender.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="other-countries">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">How can I change my name in other countries?</summary>
  <p>
    If you're not a British citizen, this website can't help you. The rules in other countries are different,
    and often more-restrictive than in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have dual citizenship, or you're a British citizen with residence elsewhere, then you usually
    <em>can</em> use a deed poll generated by FreeDeedPoll.org.uk. In this instance, you can change your
    name in the UK first, and use this name change to get ID (including your British passport) updated with
    your new name. Then, you can use this name change as part of the evidence process in the other country of
    your citizenship or residence. Most countries will accept the names of citizens of other countries that
    accept those names.

<h2 id="deeds-poll">Deeds poll</h2>

<details id="deeds-poll-as-gifts">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Can I make a deed poll for someone else?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes, but the deed poll you make won't be valid until it's signed by the person you're making it for.
    You can certainly make a deed poll as a gift for somebody, but it's up to them whether or not they
    accept it and want to use it.
  </p>

<details id="deeds-poll-for-my-child">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Can I make a deed poll for my child?</summary>
  <p>
    If your child is 16 or 17, you can make a deed poll for them in the
    <a href="#deeds-poll-as-gifts">same way as you would for any other adult</a>. Your child will need to
    be the one to sign it, and the deed poll will typically need to be accompanied by a letter signed
    by all of the child's parents in order to be accepted.
    <a href="#under-18">See this FAQ entry for more information</a>.

    Yes, completely. You don't have to pay anything to use this site. Neither does it host any advertisements

    If you find that the site is valuable to you and you'd like to give something back, you're welcome to

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> - if possible, please consider donating to your local
      branch rather than the national charity: local branches are often independent charities in their own right
      and often run on showstring budgets backed by incredible volunteer effort. As a former volunteer myself
      I've seen first hand the enormous impact that a listening ear can provide to people in crisis.

<details id="really-work">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Does this site really work?</summary>
  <p>
    Absolutely. I've personally spoken to many hundreds of people who've successfully changed their name using this

  </p>
  <p>
    Nowadays, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-unenrolled-deed-poll">gov.uk confirms the legitimacy of homemade deeds poll</a>
    (although it didn't used to, when this site was launched!), and even provides some sample text that you can
    use. This site only does the same thing, but makes it easier to produce an attractive document and provides
    help and advice on how to use it.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="security">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Is my data secure?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes. The deed poll generator on this site runs entirely in your browser: nothing - not your name or anything
    else - gets sent across the Internet to our server. This is different to every other deeds poll service we've
    ever seen. So as well as being free, this site also respects your privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    But you don't have to take our word for it. <a href="#technology">The technology that powers this site</a>
    is <a href="https://github.com/Dan-Q/freedeedpoll">released under an open source license</a>, which means that
    you or anybody else can inspect the code and verify that it's safe and secure. It also means that you can
    run a copy of your own, if you like!
  </p>
</details>

<details id="how-many">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">How many people have changed their name using this site?</summary>
  <p>
    This question is impossible to answer, because this site does not, and has never, tracked the
    people who use it! From 2011 through 2025 this site generated documents "server-side", which
    could theoretically have been used to count the number of users, but the server was always
    deliberately configured to discard all such logs as an affordance to privacy. Since 2025, this
    site has generated documents "client-side" - this means that all of the document generation
    happens on your own computer - so it's now completely impossible to count the number of people
    who've benefitted from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, based solely on the number of people who have specifically taken the
    time to email me or speak publicly about their experience of using the site, there are definintely
    in the thousands and and almost certainly in the tens, maybe even hundreds, of thousadnds of
    people who've benefitted from this fast, free and easy way to change their name.

<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>

<details id="plural-of-deed-poll">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">What is the plural of <em>deed poll</em>?</summary>
  <p>
    Surprisingly, the plural of <em>deed poll</em> is <em>deeds poll</em>, in the same way that
    the plural of <em>secretary general</em> is <em>secretaries general</em>.
  </p>
</details>

<details id="why-called-deed-poll">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Why are they called that?</summary>
  <p>
    A deed poll is a legal document signed on behalf of a single party. The popularity of a specific
    <em>kind</em> of deed poll - one to change your name! - has lead to the name <em>deed poll</em>
    becoming synonymous with that specific kind of document.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this context, a <em>deed</em> is a document that declares or affirms a fact. It descends
    from the medieval tradition of a <em>charter</em>. Deeds are used for various purposes, such as
    transferring ownership of property or granting a patent.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Polling</em> in this context refers to cutting the paper so that it has straight edges! This
    differentiates polls from<em>indentures</em>, which were contracts written out in triplicate and torn
    into three parts, with each of the two parties holding one part each and the third being kept with
    a trusted authority. This mitigated the risk of the forgery of one part of the contract: a fake part
    would not match up with the others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changing your own name by declaring it in a document never required multiple signatories, and so has
    never been a kind of indenture but a poll. And so, by descent from medieval tradition, the name
    "deed poll" suggests that the paper on which your deed poll is written is expected to have straight edges!
    One of many strange examples of how medieval law continues to shape our modern legal system.

<details id="interesting-names">
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Has anybody used this site to change their name to something particularly interesting?</summary>
  <p>
    Most of the big "paid-for" deeds poll websites (which do fundamentally the same thing as this one, but
    with glossier branding and a price tag to come with it) maintain a journalist-attracting page with a
    list of curious and intesting names that people using their site have changed their name to.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site does not do that. We don't -
    <a href="#security">in fact, we <em>can't</em></a>
    - track you, and we have no record of what names
    people enter onto the site. So while we don't have some headline-grabbing and hilarious list of funny
    and unusual names... we think that's actually a good thing. We take your privacy seriously, and -
    even if you choose a truly brilliant name - we won't be the ones to tell the world about it. That's up to
    you. It's your name, after all!

      <a href="https://changeyourstarsign.com/">Change Your Star Sign</a>, a silly spin-off of this site
      that helps you generate a certificate that proclaims that you now have a different star sign. Unlike
