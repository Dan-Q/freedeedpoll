  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">How do I change my name?</summary>
  <p>
    Common law in the United Kingdom dictates that your legal name is simply <em>the name that you are known by</em>.
    This means that, in theory, somebody who is <em>known by</em> a particular name can consider that their
    legal name. There's no specific process requied: just start using the new name!
  </p>
  <p>
    However: in practice, institutions in our modern world expect to see paperwork that backs up your assertion
    that your name has changed. That paperwork might be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>a certificate of marriage or civil partnership</strong>, by which one partner adopts the surname
      of the other,
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>a decree of divorce or dissolution</strong>, coupled with evidence of a name used prior to
      marriage or civil partnership, by which a person reverts to their pre-marital surname,
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>a statutory declaration</strong>, typically sworn in front of a magistrate or solicitor, or
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>a deed poll</strong>, a self-written statement of your name change, signed in the presence of
      witnesses.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This website provides help and support with producing a deed poll for free.

  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Why would I change my name?</summary>
  <p>
    There are many reasons why you might want to change your name. Some common reasons include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To share a surname with a partner, child, or other family member</li>
    <li>To have a name that better reflects your cultural identity</li>
    <li>To formally make use of a nickname that you're already known by</li>
    <li>To make your name easier to pronounce or spell</li>
    <li>To represent a new start or a fresh beginning</li>
    <li>To assert your independence from your previous name and those you shared it with</li>
    <li>To avoid confusion with someone more-famous who shares your previous name</li>
    <li>To better reflect your gender identity, or to avoid being misgendered</li>
    <li>To add, remove, or re-arrange your middle name(s)</li>
    <li>To avoid discrimination based on your previous name</li>
    <li>To revert a name to its historical form</li>
    <li>To recognise someone important to you by adopting some or all of their name</li>
    <li>To adopt a name that is more-fitting to your religious beliefs</li>
    <li>To make day-to-day use of a stage name or pen name for which you've become known</li>
    <li>To have an unusual name that brings you amusement or joy</li>
    <li>To simply having a name that you prefer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It doesn't matter what your reason is, though: with few limitations (described elsewhere in this
    FAQ), you're legally entitled to change your name to whatever you want, for any reason you want.

  <p>
    This question is impossible to answer, because this site does not, and has never, tracked the
    people who use it! From 2011 through 2025 this site generated documents "server-side", which
    could theoretically have been used to count the number of users, but the server was always
    deliberately configured to discard all such logs as an affordance to privacy. Since 2025, this
    site has generated documents "client-side" - this means that all of the document generation
    happens on your own computer - so it's now completely impossible to count the number of people
    who've benefitted from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, based solely on the number of people who have specifically taken the
    time to email me or speak publicly about their experience of using the site, there are definintely
    in the thousands and and almost certainly in the tens, maybe even hundreds, of thousadnds of
    people who've benefitted from this fast, free and easy way to change their name.

  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">What is the plural of <em>deed poll</em>?</summary>
  <p>
    Surprisingly, the plural of <em>deed poll</em> is <em>deeds poll</em>, in the same way that
    the plural of <em>secretary general</em> is <em>secretaries general</em>.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary role="button" class="contrast outline">Why are they called that?</summary>
  <p>
    A deed poll is a legal document signed on behalf of a single party. The popularity of a specific
    <em>kind</em> of deed poll - one to change your name! - has lead to the name <em>deed poll</em>
    becoming synonymous with that specific kind of document.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this context, a <em>deed</em> is a document that declares or affirms a fact. It descends
    from the medieval tradition of a <em>charter</em>. Deeds are used for various purposes, such as
    transferring ownership of property or granting a patent.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Polling</em> in this context refers to cutting the paper so that it has straight edges! This
    differentiates polls from<em>indentures</em>, which were contracts written out in triplicate and torn
    into three parts, with each of the two parties holding one part each and the third being kept with
    a trusted authority. This mitigated the risk of the forgery of one part of the contract: a fake part
    would not match up with the others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changing your own name by declaring it in a document never required multiple signatories, and so has
    never been a kind of indenture but a poll. And so, by descent from medieval tradition, the name
    "deed poll" suggests that the paper on which your deed poll is written is expected to have straight edges!
    One of many strange examples of how medieval law continues to shape our modern legal system.
