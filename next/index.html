<h1>Next Steps with your Free Deed Poll</h1>
<p>
  Congratulations! You've <a href="/start">created your deed poll</a>; your name has legally been changed!
  What next?
</p>
<p>
  There are lots of people you'll need to contact to tell them about your name change. Here's a list to help
  you get started: it's arranged so that some of the most-important are at the top. Probably not all of them will
  apply to you. Those which might involve paying a fee to a government department are marked with: üí∑.
</p>

<ul class="deed-poll-checklist">

      üí∑ Passport Office
    </label>
    <small>
      If you hold a passport, you'll need to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport" target="_blank">renew your passport</a>
      to get it updated with your new name. You'll need to pay the renewal fee, but you may be entitled to
      carry-over some of the remaining months of validity of your old passport into the lifespan of your
      new passport. HM Passport Office will need you to send them an original deed poll (not a photocopy),
      but if you've followed our advice to sign multiple originals in the same sitting, this shouldn't be
      a problem.
      <br>
      As a piece of government-issued photo ID, getting your passport updated promptly can be very-helpful
      in demonstrating your name change to other organisations.

    </label>
    <small>
      If you hold a driving licence, you'll need to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence" target="_blank">renew your driving license</a>
      it to reflect your new name. You'll need to pay the renewal fee. The DVLA will need you to send them
      an original deed poll (not a photocopy), but if you've followed our advice to sign multiple originals
      in the same sitting, this shouldn't be a problem.

      Police
    </label>
    <small>
      Most people do not need to contact the police about their name change. But if you're part of an ongoing
      investigation or especially if you're a registered sex offender, violent offender, or terrorist offender,
      it could be a criminal offence to fail to inform your local prescribed police station of the change.
    </small>

    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-other-photo-id">
    <label for="checklist-other-photo-id">
      Other Photo ID
    </label>
    <small>
      Have other widely-respected photo ID, like a CitizenCard or PASS Card? They're worth getting updated
      promptly for the same reasons as those above. These agencies will often require sight of an original deed
      poll, too.

      DVLA (Vehicle Logbooks)

      If you own/are the registered keeper of a vehicle, you'll need to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/change-name-v5c" target="_blank">get the vehicle log book (V5C) updated</a>.
      This is free.

      Bank
    </label>
    <small>
      To ensure that you're able to accept payments in your new name, you'll need to contact your bank.
      Most people have no problem getting
      this sorted, but a word of warning: some banks have historically made it difficult for people who've
      changed their name using what they consider a "home made" deed poll: if you have trouble with your bank,
      <a href="/rejection/">we've got some tips for you</a>.

    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-credit-card">
    <label for="checklist-credit-card">
      Credit Card Providers
    </label>
    <small>
      If you've got a credit card, let your credit card provider know. Credit card companies tend to be
      faster and more-cooperative about name changes than banks. They might require sight of an original
      deed poll.

    <small>
      If you have a mortgage (other than with your bank), a loan, or any other kind of financial product,
      you'll need to contact your provider and let them know about the change. They might require sight of
      an original deed poll.

      State Benefits
    </label>
    <small>
      If you're in receipt of state benefits, you'll need to contact the relevant agencies to let them know.
      There are online guides for reporting name changes
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances" target="_blank">for Jobseeker's Allowance</a>,
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances" target="_blank">for Universal Credit</a>,
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance-report-change" target="_blank">for Carer's Allowance</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-pension-service/report-changes" target="_blank">for the state pension</a>, for example.

      your correct name on file is important if you have to make a claim.

    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-employer">
    <label for="checklist-employer">
      Employer
    </label>
    <small>
      If you're employed, you'll need to ensure that your employer has your correct name. Employers are generally
      pretty-understanding and often it's sufficient to show somebody from HR your deed poll or a photocopy of it.
      Make sure they update the payroll systems so that - once you've updated your name with your bank - it
      doesn't ring any alarm bells when your paycheque gets processed!

    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-hmrc">
    <label for="checklist-hmrc">
      HMRC
    </label>
    <small>
      If you're self-employed, you'll need to
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tell-hmrc-change-of-details" target="_blank">tell HMRC about your name change</a>. If you're
      employed and paid via PAYE, your employer may be able to update HMRC for you. If you're not employed, you
      might need to contact HMRC yourself to ensure that your National Insurance record is correctly updated.

    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-education">
    <label for="checklist-education">
      School, College, or University
    </label>
    <small>
      If you're in education, make sure you get your name correctly updated with your school, college, or university.
      Many educators have a policy of not re-issuing qualifications and certificates in a different name, so if you
      want your new name on your qualification, ensure they're told about it before you sit any exams!

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-utilities">
    <label for="checklist-utilities">
      Utility Companies
    </label>
    <small>
      If you pay an electricity, gas, water, or broadband bill, you'll need to let your supplier know about the change.
      So long as you're still paying them, they don't usually mind if they're not high on your priority list. But
      having a utility bill with your new name on it can provide you with a helpful proof-of-address, should you need
      one.
    </small>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-local-authority">
    <label for="checklist-local-authority">
      Local Authority
    </label>
    <small>
      Your local authority is responsible for collecting Council Tax and maintaining the Electoral Roll, both of
      which benefit from having your correct name. You're likely to have to send a copy of your deed poll.
    </small>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-medical">
    <label for="checklist-medical">
      Doctor &amp; Dentist
    </label>
    <small>
      Let your GP and your dentist know about the change. They might need to see a copy of your deed poll. Your GP
      can update your NHS record, but it can take a while to be reflected everywhere.

    <input type="checkbox" id="checklist-friends">
    <label for="checklist-friends">
      Friends and Family
    </label>
    <small>
      Often the easiest people to update, but worth remembering, especially if you've made only minor changes to your
      name (e.g. adding or removing middle names or adjusting the spelling of a name) that you might otherwise fail
      to mention. These kinds of details can be important if, for example, you're mentioned in a will or other legal
      document.

      If you own land, it's worth making sure that the Land Registry has your correct name, which may be important
      in the event of a dispute.
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1" target="_blank">There's a form to fill out</a>
      and a small fee to pay.

      Social Media
    </label>
    <small>
      Most social media platforms make it easy to change your name, but some - especially Facebook and LinkedIn -
      can require that you provide proof of your name change: this is easiest if you've arranged for your photo
      ID to be updated first!

      be told about name changes.
